STM32CubeIDE Project Diagnostics
================================

1. Project Name in .project file: "Pack Controller EEPROM"
2. References in .cproject have been updated to match

Common STM32CubeIDE Import Issues:
- Try "Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace" instead of "Import from Directory"
- Make sure to select the parent directory containing .project file
- Check "Copy projects into workspace" if needed
- Try refreshing the project (F5) after import
- Check if .metadata folder in workspace is corrupted

Alternative Solutions:
1. Close STM32CubeIDE
2. Delete .metadata folder in workspace
3. Restart STM32CubeIDE and import project again

Or try:
1. File > New > STM32 Project from Existing STM32CubeMX Configuration File (.ioc)
2. Browse to "Pack Controller EEPROM.ioc"
3. This will regenerate project files
