# Module-Controller Communication Performance Metrics

## Response Time Characteristics

### Single Module Performance
- **Typical response time**: 10ms
- **After announcement request**: 
  - First response: 4-51ms (variable due to 500ms pause and resync)
  - Returns to normal 10ms within 1-2 cycles

### Test Data (Single Module)
```
Normal operation: 1[10] (10ms response time, very consistent)
After announcement: 1[51] then 1[6] then back to 1[10]
```

## Key Findings

1. **Consistent Performance**: Module responds within 10ms under normal conditions
2. **No Timeouts**: Announcement requests no longer cause module timeouts
3. **Quick Recovery**: Response times normalize within 1-2 polling cycles after announcements

## Implementation Details

### Response Time Tracking
- Timestamp recorded when status request sent (`statusRequestSent`)
- Time calculated when first status message (Status1) received
- Display format: `ID[time_ms]` (e.g., `1[10]` = module 1, 10ms response)

### Announcement Request Handling
- Polling suspended during announcement to prevent interference
- 500ms pause allows modules to respond
- Polling resumes immediately after with forced status request

## Next Steps

1. Test with multiple modules to verify scaling
2. Monitor for any edge cases with 2+ modules
3. Consider reducing announcement pause from 500ms if needed
4. Analyze max response times under load conditions
