# Pack-Controller-EEPROM

**ModBatt Battery Management System - Pack Controller**

## Overview

The Pack-Controller is the top-tier controller in ModBatt's hierarchical battery management system, coordinating up to 32 battery modules while interfacing with Vehicle Control Units (VCUs) and providing system-level management. This repository demonstrates how distributed intelligence principles scale to the pack level in production embedded hardware.

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **Production-ready** - Complete firmware with dual CAN bus architecture, EEPROM emulation, and comprehensive module coordination

### Quick Facts

- **Target Platform**: STM32WB55 microcontroller (Dual-core ARM Cortex-M4/M0+)
- **Manages**: Up to 32 battery modules via CAN bus (4096 cells total)
- **Interfaces**: Dual CAN (VCU + Modules), Bluetooth LE capable (hardware ready)
- **Storage**: Flash-based EEPROM emulation with wear leveling
- **Features**: Real-time pack state estimation, fault detection, module health tracking

## Development

### Build Environment

**Important**: This project uses STM32CubeIDE (available for Windows/Linux). The Pack Emulator uses Borland C++ Builder 6 (Windows only) and cannot be built from WSL/Linux.

### Getting Started

1. **Firmware**: Open project in STM32CubeIDE
2. **Emulator**: Build in Windows using C++ Builder 6
3. **Testing**: Use emulator for hardware-in-loop validation

See individual documentation in `docs/` for detailed setup instructions.
